* WeatherPy utilizes APIs to vizualize the weather of a random sample of cities of varying distance from the equator. All visualizations include written analysis and save to the output folder. 
* VacationPy builds on WeatherPy, further utilizing APIs to find the most ideal vacation destinations based on weather preference, as well as providing nearby accomodation recommendations. The final heatmap with markers is saved in the output folder.
